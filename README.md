# Community-Aware Link Prediction (CALP) Algorithm

## 3.1 Introduction

In the realm of social networks, understanding and predicting the formation of connections between entities is crucial. The CALP algorithm is a novel approach designed to leverage the inherent community structures present in many real-world networks.

## 3.2 Purpose

The primary objective of the CALP algorithm is to predict potential future links in a network. Unlike traditional link prediction methods that rely solely on the network's structural properties, CALP incorporates community information. This approach recognizes that nodes within the same community are more likely to connect than those outside their community.

## 3.3 Problem Statement

Given a network where links between nodes represent relationships (e.g., friendships), the goal is to predict potential future links or identify missing current links. This prediction considers both direct node interactions and the broader community structures.

## 3.4 Aims

- **Enhanced Prediction Accuracy**: By integrating community information, CALP aims for better accuracy than methods that overlook community structures.
- **Holistic Network Understanding**: CALP provides a comprehensive network understanding by considering both node interactions and community dynamics.

## Algorithm Structure

The CALP algorithm combines various techniques for robustness and accuracy.
